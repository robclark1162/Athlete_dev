        <h1>TAYLOR ATHLETE DEVELOPMENT mantra is ‘good for 12 not at 12’, this is a line to describe how I coach. My
            goal with any young athlete, is to help learn the skills of training for one event with another eye on the
            future.
            A life lesson.
        </h1>
        <H2>COACHING: I offer a comprehensive programme relevant to the athlete’s chosen event that is aimed to fit into
            life not take over life.

        <p>

            I offer at least 2 technical sessions per week over the winter months including strength sessions as
            well as lone sessions to fit the event.
            I run 2 tiers of training. TEAM TAYLOR is my group where athletics is their chosen sport and the
            athlete is competing at a high level. I expect these athletes to be competing regularly. I will only hold 8
            places
            for this. DEVELOPMENT GROUP. This group is usually under 14, new, or learning the sport, athletics is a
            secondary sport. I’ll loosely max at 12 places

            COMMUNICATION, All communications will be via parent/caregiver unless permission is given to
            communicate with the athlete. I run a closed group Facebook page where I (with consent) will post videos of
            trainings to view and review.
